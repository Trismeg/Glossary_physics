    description={Speed is a scalar quantity that measures how fast an object is moving. The equation for speed is amount of distance divided by amount of time. If the object is able to cover large amount of distance in a short time it moves at a fast speed however if it cover a small distance in the same amount of time it's a slow object.Instantaneous Speed - the speed at any given instant in time.
Average Speed - the average of all instantaneous speeds; found simply by a distance/time ratio
