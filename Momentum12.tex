 +   deskription={the product of the mass and velocity of an object. Like velocity, linear momentum is a vector quantity, possessing a direction as well as a magnitude. It is also a conserved quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change. In classical mechanics, conservation of linear momentum is implied by Newton's laws. }
