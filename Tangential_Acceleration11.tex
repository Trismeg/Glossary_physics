    name=Tangential Acceleration,
    description={Tangential acceleration is a measure of how the tangential velocity of a point at a certain radius changes with time. Tangential acceleration is just like linear acceleration, but itâ€™s particular to the tangential direction, which is relevant to circular motion.}
