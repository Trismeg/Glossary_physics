    name=Exponential decay,
    description={A quantity is subject to exponential decay if it decreases at a rate proportional to its current value. Symbolically, this process can be expressed by the following differential equation, where N is the quantity and Î» (lambda) is a positive rate called the exponential decay constant:

\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N}
