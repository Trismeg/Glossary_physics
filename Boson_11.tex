    name=Boson,
    description={Boson is a particle that follows Bose-Einstein statics. Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions. In my opinion, Boson is a type of particle which can stick the proton and neutron together. It can produce a strong force between particles. Gluon and photon are part of Boson.}
