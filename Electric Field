Electric field 
An electric field is generated by electrically charged particles and time-varying magnetic fields. The electric field describes the electric force experienced by a motionless electrically charged test particle at any point in space relative to the source(s) of the field. 

The electric field a distance r away from a point charge Q is given by: 
Electric field from a point charge : E = k Q / r(squared)
