    name=Muon12,
    description={The muon  is an elementary particle similar to the electron, with electric charge of −1 e and a spin of 1⁄2, but with a much greater mass. It is classified as a lepton. As is the case with other leptons, the muon is not believed to have any sub-structure—that is, it is not thought to be composed of any simpler particles.}
