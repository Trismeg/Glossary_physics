{
    name= Mass Defect,
    description={Is the difference between the calculated mass of the unbond system and the experimentally meassured mass of the nucleus,the mass defect can be explained using Albert Einsten's formula, expressing the equivalence of energy and mass. By this formula, adding energy also increases mass, whereas removing energy decreases mass}
