    name=coulomb force,
    description={Coulomb force, also called electrostatic force or Coulomb interaction, attraction or repulsion of particles or objects because of their electric charge. One of the basic physical forces, the electric force is named for a French physicist, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who in 1785 published the results of an experimental investigation into the correct quantitative description of this force. $$F_e=\frac{q_1q_2k_e}{r^2}$$ Coulomb force is a force between two charged particles, where q1 is one charged particle, q2 is another, ke is electrostatic constant and r is the radius.}
