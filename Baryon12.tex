 +   deskription={ Particles made up of three quarks are called baryons; the two best known baryons are the proton (made up of two up quarks and one down) and the neutron (two down quarks and one up). Together with the mesons – particles comprised of a quark and an antiquark – baryons form the hadrons. They’re part of the name of the world’s most powerful particle collider, the Large Hadron Collider, the LHC. }
