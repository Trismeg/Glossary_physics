\newglossaryentry{Temperature}
Temperature is an important quantity in thermodynamics and kinetic theory, appearing explicitly for example in the ideal gas law, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, and R is the universal gas constant. Thermodynamically, temperature is given by the Maxwell relation, where E is the energy, S is the entropy, and the partial derivative is taken at constant volume. The quantity , where k is Boltzmann's constant, arising frequently in thermodynamics is defined as a quantity sometimes known as thermodynamic beta.
