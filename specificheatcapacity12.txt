Specific heat capacity - is the amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree Celsius. The relationship between heat and temperature changes usually expressed in the form Q = c m (delta) T , where ce is the specific heat. The relationship does not apply if a phase change is encountered, because the heat added or removed during a phase change does not change the temperature.
